# Memory Game App
<h2>Link to working site</h2>

<h2>About:</h2>
<p>This was a 2-day individual project I worked on at the end of week 7 of the CodeClan course.  It's based on a toy called 'Simon', which ~I had when I was younger.  I chose to make this project to consolidate React and MongoDB and to challenge myself with a project that required some game logic.  As I learned new things on the course, such as UseContext, React Modal, I applied them to this project as a way of practicing them.
